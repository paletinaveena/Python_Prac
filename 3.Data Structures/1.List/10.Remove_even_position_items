# By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing the 0th, 2nd, 4th,6th numbers in [12,24,35,70,88,120,155].
# Method - 1
l = [12,24,35,70,88,120,155]
l = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l)) if i%2 != 0]
print(l)

# Method - 2 (using enumerate)
li = [12,24,35,70,88,120,155]
li = [x for (i,x) in enumerate(li) if i%2!=0]
print(li)
